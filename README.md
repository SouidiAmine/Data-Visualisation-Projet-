USTHB Classroom Availability and Schedule Viewer
is a small website to view the schedule for the USTHB (University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene). Users can input the date and time, select a specific classroom, and check whether it's available or occupied. In case the classroom is occupied, the website provides information such as the professor's name, the section, and the module being taught. This website helps students and faculty members easily access important scheduling information for their classes and activities at USTHB, improving efficiency and time management.
